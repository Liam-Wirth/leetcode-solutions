### Problem Description
Given a list of words and a string `s`, count how many words in the list are prefixes of `s`.

---

### Intuition
The problem boils down to checking whether each word in the list is a prefix of the string `s`. Depending on the language chosen syntax changes a bit but this problem can be relatively easily solved by using language builtins, for exampl Rust provides the `str::starts_with(&str)` method, Java, and Python provide simmilar methods for these problems as well. C++ has no such method, but it's not a real big hurdle as all you'd need to do is compare substrings using standard library

This kind of problem is nice since it just checks to make sure you know some basics surrounding your language of choice. Not too difficult otherwise.

---

### Approach
1. Iterate through the list of words.
2. For each word, check if it is a prefix of `s`.
3. Maintain a counter to track how many words satisfy the prefix condition.
4. Return the final count.

This approach is efficient as checking if a word is a prefix of `s` can often be done in $$O(m)$$, where `m` is the length of the word.

---

### Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $$O(n \cdot m)$$  
  Where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of the words, as we need to compare each word with the prefix of `s`.
  
- **Space complexity**: $$O(1)$$  
  No additional space is used other than a counter.

#### Rust

```rust []
impl Solution {
    pub fn count_prefixes(words: Vec<String>, s: String) -> i32 {
        let mut count = 0;
        for w in words {
            if s.starts_with(w.as_str()) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }
        count
    }
}
```
```python []
class Solution:
    def countPrefixes(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for word in words:
            if s.startswith(word):
                count += 1
        return count
```
```java []
class Solution {
    public int countPrefixes(String[] words, String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (s.startsWith(word)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
```C++ []
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrefixes(vector<string>& words, string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const string& word : words) {
            if (s.substr(0, word.size()) == word) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
```ruby []
class Solution
    def count_prefixes(words, s)
        count = 0
        words.each do |word|
            count += 1 if s.start_with?(word)
        end
        count
    end
end
```
