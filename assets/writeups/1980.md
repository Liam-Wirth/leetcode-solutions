# Two solutions, a bad/intuitive one, and a fast one

# Solution 1 | Intuitive brute force

## Intuition
When I first approached this problem, my initial thought was to use a brute force method. Given an array of binary strings, I wanted to generate all possible binary strings of the same length and check which one is not present in the array. This seemed like a straightforward way to ensure that I find a unique binary string.

## Approach
In my first implementation, I used a brute force approach:
1. Convert each binary string in the array to a set for quick lookup.
2. Generate all possible binary strings of length `N` (where `N` is the length of the strings in the array).
3. Check each generated string against the set to see if it is unique.
4. Return the first unique string found.

This approach works as a quick and dirty solution, but it has a time complexity of $$O(2^n * n)$$, which is inefficient for larger values of `N`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(2^n * n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

## Code

```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string> &nums) {
        int N = nums.size();
        unordered_set<string> s(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << N); ++i) {
            string candidate(N, '0');
            for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
                if (i & (1 << j)) {
                    candidate[N - j - 1] = '1';
                }
            }
            if (s.find(candidate) == s.end()) {
                return candidate;
            }
        }
        return ""; // This line should never be reached
    }
};
```

```rust []
use std::collections::HashSet;

impl Solution {
    pub fn find_different_binary_string(nums: Vec<String>) -> String {
        let n = nums.len();
        let s: HashSet<String> = nums.into_iter().collect();
        for i in 0..(1 << n) {
            let mut candidate = vec!['0'; n];
            for j in 0..n {
                if i & (1 << j) != 0 {
                    candidate[n - j - 1] = '1';
                }
            }
            let candidate: String = candidate.into_iter().collect();
            if !s.contains(&candidate) {
                return candidate;
            }
        }
        unreachable!()
    }
}
```

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(nums)
        s = set(nums)
        for i in range(1 << n):
            candidate = ''.join('1' if i & (1 << j) else '0' for j in range(n-1, -1, -1))
            if candidate not in s:
                return candidate
        return ""  # This line should never be reached
```

# Solution two: Optimized approach through Cantor's diagonalization

## Intuition
After some thought, I remembered Cantor's diagonalization method something that my theoretical computer science class actually covered last semester.It's a theory which provides a more efficient way to find a unique member of a language, and a great distinction between countably and uncountably infinite sets. Veritasium has a great video on it that you can watch here, It's moreso about the Hilbert Hotel paradox, but towards the end he mentions diagonalization as a method to find a value that is gaurunteed to not be within the set.

This method ensures that the resulting string is different from each string in the array at the `i`-th position.

## Approach
1. Initialize an empty result string of length `N`.
2. For each index `i` from 0 to `N-1`, flip the `i`-th bit of the `i`-th string in the array and append it to the result string.
3. This guarantees that the resulting string is different from each string in the array at the `i`-th position.
4. Return the result string.

This approach has a time complexity of $$O(n)$$, which is significantly better.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

## Code

```cpp []
// DIAGONALIZATION!!! YES YES!!!
class Solution {
public:
  string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string> &nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    string res(n, '0');
    // iter from 0 to n-1:
    // if the ith character of ith string is 0 append 1 to res, else append 0
    // gaurunteed to be unique
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      res[i] = nums[i][i] == '0' ? '1' : '0';
    }
    return res;
  }
};
```

```rust []
impl Solution {
    pub fn find_different_binary_string(nums: Vec<String>) -> String {
        let n = nums.len();
        let mut res = vec!['0'; n];
        for i in 0..n {
            res[i] = if nums[i].as_bytes()[i] == b'0' { '1' } else { '0' };
        }
        res.into_iter().collect()
    }
}
```
```python []
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(nums)
        res = ['0'] * n
        for i in range(n):
            res[i] = '1' if nums[i][i] == '0' else '0'
        return ''.join(res)
```
