# Intuition
The problem requires checking if words in `words1` satisfy all the frequency constraints imposed by the words in `words2`. A key insight is that instead of checking each word in `words2` for every word in `words1`, we can **merge the constraints of all words in `words2` into a single frequency requirement**. This allows us to reduce the number of comparisons significantly.

# Approach
1. Compute the maximum frequency of each character required across all words in `words2`. This is stored in a `maxf` dictionary in Python or a `HashMap` in Rust.
2. For each word in `words1`, compute its frequency count and check if it satisfies the constraints in `maxf`.
3. Add words that satisfy the constraints to the result list.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**:
  - \(O(M + N \cdot K)\), where:
    - \(M\) is the total number of characters in all words in `words2`.
    - \(N\) is the number of words in `words1`.
    - \(K\) is the average length of words in `words1`.

- **Space complexity**: \(O(U)\), where \(U\) is the number of unique characters in the alphabet (constant for English letters).

# Code
```rust []
use std::collections::HashMap;

impl Solution {
    pub fn word_subsets(words1: Vec<String>, words2: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {
        // Step 1: Build the combined max frequency requirements from words2
        let mut maxf = HashMap::new();
        for b in &words2 {
            let freq_b = Self::char_frequency(b);
            for (&ch, &count) in &freq_b {
                maxf.insert(ch, maxf.get(&ch).cloned().unwrap_or(0).max(count));
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Check each word in words1
        let mut result = Vec::new();
        for a in &words1 {
            let freq_a = Self::char_frequency(a);
            if maxf.iter().all(|(&ch, &count)| freq_a.get(&ch).cloned().unwrap_or(0) >= count) {
                result.push(a.clone());
            }
        }

        result
    }

    // Helper function to calculate character frequency
    fn char_frequency(word: &str) -> HashMap<char, usize> {
        let mut freq = HashMap::new();
        for ch in word.chars() {
            *freq.entry(ch).or_insert(0) += 1;
        }
        freq
    }
}

```
```python []
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def wordSubsets(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Step 1: Compute the combined max frequency requirements for words2
        maxf = Counter()
        for b in words2:
            freq_b = Counter(b)
            for ch, count in freq_b.items():
                maxf[ch] = max(maxf[ch], count)

        # Step 2: Check each word in words1
        result = []
        for a in words1:
            freq_a = Counter(a)
            if all(freq_a[ch] >= maxf[ch] for ch in maxf):
                result.append(a)

        return result
