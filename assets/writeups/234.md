# Intuition
The problem requires checking whether a singly linked list is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forward and backward. 

My first thought was to extract all values from the linked list into an array, then check whether the array is the same when reversed. While this approach works, it requires **O(n)** additional space, which is not optimal.

To improve on this, I realized that we could **reverse the second half of the linked list** in place and then compare it with the first half. This approach eliminates the need for extra space beyond a few pointers.

# Approach

## First Approach (Using Extra Space)
1. Traverse the linked list and store its values in an array.
2. Check whether the array reads the same forward and backward using list reversal (`vals[::-1]`).
3. Return `True` if they match, `False` otherwise.
### First Approach Solutions
```python []

#class ListNode:
#    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#        self.val = val
#        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        vals = []
        walk = head
        while walk:
            vals.append(walk.val)
            walk = walk.next
        return vals == vals[::-1]
```
``` rust []
impl Solution {
    pub fn is_palindrome(head: Option<Box<ListNode>>) -> bool {
        let mut values = Vec::new();
        let mut current = &head;

        // Store values in a vector
        while let Some(node) = current {
            values.push(node.val);
            current = &node.next;
        }

        // Check if the vector is a palindrome
        values.iter().eq(values.iter().rev())
    }
}
```
### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$ (traversing the list and checking the reversed array)
- **Space Complexity:** $$O(n)$$ (storing the values in an array)



## Optimized Approach (Constant Space)
We can do better than that though!
1. **Find the middle** of the linked list using the **slow and fast pointer** technique.
   - Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time.
   - When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.
2. **Reverse the second half** of the linked list in place.
   - Reverse the list starting from `slow` and store the new head in `prev`.
3. **Compare the first half and the reversed second half**.
   - Iterate from both `head` and `prev`, checking if corresponding nodes match.
4. If all values match, return `True`, otherwise return `False`.

### Code:
```python []
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        # list with no, or 1 value is by definition a palindrome
        if not head or not head.next:
            return True 

        slow = fast = head

        #first we need to find the middle of the list using two pointers
        # by advancing the fast pointer twice as fast as the slow pointer, it holds that by the time 
        # the fast pointer hits the end of the list, the slow pointer will be halfway to the end of the list, thus, at the midpoint
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # now we reverse the second half of the list:

        prev = None
        while slow:
            temp = slow.next
            slow.next = prev
            prev = slow
            slow = temp


        # now we are basically comparing two lists (first and second half), 
        left = head # first half
        right = prev # second half

        while right:
            if left.val != right.val:
                return False
            left = left.next
            right = right.next
        # if we dont return in the above, then it's a palindromic linked list and we can return true
        return True

```
```rust []
impl Solution {
    pub fn is_palindrome(head: Option<Box<ListNode>>) -> bool {
        let mut slow = &head;
        let mut fast = &head;

        // Find the middle of the list
        while fast.is_some() && fast.as_ref().unwrap().next.is_some() {
            slow = &slow.as_ref().unwrap().next;
            fast = &fast.as_ref().unwrap().next.as_ref().unwrap().next;
        }

        // Reverse the second half
        let mut prev = None;
        let mut current = slow.clone();
        while let Some(mut node) = current {
            current = node.next.take();
            node.next = prev;
            prev = Some(node);
        }

        // Compare both halves
        let mut left = &head;
        let mut right = &prev;
        while right.is_some() {
            if left.as_ref().unwrap().val != right.as_ref().unwrap().val {
                return false;
            }
            left = &left.as_ref().unwrap().next;
            right = &right.as_ref().unwrap().next;
        }

        true
    }
}

```

### Optimized Approach
- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$ (finding the middle, reversing, and comparing the two halves)
- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$ (only using a few pointers)
