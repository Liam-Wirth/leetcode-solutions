# leetcode-solutions
thought I may store my leetcode solutions on github, don't trust my code though it's probably bad.

##The solutions are in the editor file, I do all my leetcoding using a plugin for intellij, and it has everything in the app, so there are even questions stored in this directory

#as of June 2022, all of my solutions are in java, as that is the language I currently know and am comfortable with, but my goal is to expand to other languages once I learn them!
