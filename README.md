## About
I created this repository when I decided to start practicing leetcode in my freetime as a senior in highschool (cerca January 2022), knowing only java at the time (I learned the language on my own, and got better at it through AP Computer Science) the bulk of the solutions are likely in java, as of right now (June 2022) I'm still most comfortable with java, but plan to extend into other languages such as C and Rust.

I guess a bit of a cool goal for this project is to have more than a thousand leetcode solutions documented in this repo in a multitude of different languages, but I don't know if that's gonna happen anytime soon

## Usage

Honestly, this repo primarily exists for personal use, and logging my improvement as a programmer/computer scientist over time, Use my solutions at your own risk, as there are likely better ones out there! :)
