## About
I created this repository when I decided to start practicing leetcode in my freetime as a senior in highschool (cerca January 2022), knowing only java at the time (I learned the language on my own, and got better at it through AP Computer Science) the bulk of the solutions are likely in java, as of right now (June 2022) I'm still most comfortable with java, but plan to extend into other languages such as C and Rust.

I guess a bit of a cool goal for this project is to have more than a thousand leetcode solutions documented in this repo in a multitude of different languages, but I don't know if that's gonna happen anytime soon

## Usage

Honestly, this repo primarily exists for personal use, and logging my improvement as a programmer/computer scientist over time, Use my solutions at your own risk, as there are likely better ones out there! :)

| :-------------: |:------------------|:-:|
| **June 4th 2022** | Today, I successfully coded an entire solution all by myself without giving up and seeing how someone else did it, I achieved this on Leetcode Problem 169, the code that I initially submitted without any outside support can be seen in the Alternate-Solution subclass of the file!| [Leetcode Problem 169 (Java Solution)](editor/en/Java/169.majority-element.java)  
|**June 4th 2022**| First Rust solution! | [Leetcode 2235 Add Two Integers](editor/en/rust/2235.add-two-integers.rs)
|**June 6th 2022**| First Ruby Solution | [Leetcode 2235 Add Two Integers](editor/en/Ruby/2235.add-two-integers.rb)
|**January 11th 2023| First independant Rust solution AND explanation! | [Leetcode 12 Integer to Roman](editor/en/rust/src/12_roman-to-integer.rs)|
|**February 12 2024| First tried a medium problem, and it ran on first try, as well as had the answer accepted| [leetcode 2149 Rearrange Array elements by sign](/rust/src/rearrange_array_elements_by_sign_2149.rs)|
