# Intuition
I tend to be warry of using recursion, simply because I just don't like it, and feel like it tends to lead to harder to read code, but as I was writing out my solution for this problem I realized I was basically just writing out all of my base cases, and essentially just writing a recursive solution as is, so i thought I'd run with it.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
Figuring out time complexity for recursion is tricky, (part of the reason as to why I don't like it), but my best guess would be $$O(n^2)$$ as it looks like the work done in each recursive call is linear in the worst case? As well as linear work being done in the base call, thus $$ n \times n $$. Please correct me in the comments if I'm wrong :)

- Space complexity:
Again shaky on this one, please call me out if I'm being dumb and I'll edit my solution accordingly, but, I'm pretty sure the space of this solution would be $$O(n)$$ with the worst case being the length of the string, hence the linear time. I am not modifying the string in place, thus not creating new instances of the string on the stack, and am instead just adjusting my pointers for each recursive call. I'm pretty sure if I was adjusting the string in place I would have an $$O(n^2)$$ Solution.

```python []
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
       return self.helper(s, 0, len(s) - 1)
    def helper(self, s: str, start: int, end: int) -> int:
        if start == end:
            return 1
        if s[start] != s[end]:
            return end - start + 1
        else:
            while start < end and s[start] == s[start + 1]:
                start += 1
            while start < end and s[end] == s[end - 1]:
                end -= 1
            if start == end:
                return 0
            return self.helper(s, start + 1, end - 1)
```
```rust []
impl Solution {
    pub fn minimum_length(s: String) -> i32 {
        let s_bytes = s.as_bytes();
        Self::helper(&s_bytes, 0, s_bytes.len() - 1)
    }

    fn helper(s: &[u8], start: usize, end: usize) -> i32 {
        if start == end {
            return 1;
        }
        if s[start] != s[end] {
            return (end - start + 1) as i32;
        } else {
            let mut new_start = start;
            let mut new_end = end;
            while new_start < new_end && s[new_start] == s[new_start + 1] {
                new_start += 1;
            }
            while new_start < new_end && s[new_end] == s[new_end - 1] {
                new_end -= 1;
            }
            if new_start == new_end {
                return 0;
            }
            return Self::helper(s, new_start + 1, new_end - 1);
        }
    }
}
```
