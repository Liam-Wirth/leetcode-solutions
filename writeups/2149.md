# Intuition
Given the problem and it's constraints the first thing that popped into my head was just to split  the vector into two vectors, one for positive, the other for negative numbers, and then just merge them into a new array.

# Approach
Basically just did what popped into my head above.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(n)$$

# Code
```


impl Solution {
    pub fn rearrange_array(nums: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {

        let mut pos: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
        let mut neg: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

        for num in nums.iter() {
            if *num >= 0 {
                pos.push(*num);
            } else {
                neg.push(*num);
            }
        };
        let mut out : Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    for (i , num) in pos.iter().enumerate() {
        out.push(*num);
        out.push(neg[i]);
    };
    out
}
}
```
