Looking at the probem, I saw that the size of the final array was 2n, and the output was just "Number at i, followed by number at i+n" so the way I whent about solving the problem was to first, split the array in half, and then to zip the arrays together. May not be the fastest, but is short and easy to understand.
``` RUBY 
def shuffle(nums, n)
    x = nums.slice(0, n);
    y = nums.slice(n, n*2);
   x.zip(y).flatten.compact
end
