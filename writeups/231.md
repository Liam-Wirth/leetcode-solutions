# Intuition / explanation
After taking intro to logic classes, the first 10 or so powers of 2 are engrained into my head, and I can remember what they look like in decimal, binary, and hex. As a result, I know that any number that is a power of 2 will only have one bit set high, and all the others set to zero. Conversely, the binary representation of a power of two minus one, will have all the bits before it set to one, and be one bit shorter. (Kind of like the difference between 10, and 9 in our base 10 number system)

  $$2$$  $$\longrightarrow$$ $$10$$ ,  $$1$$  $$\longrightarrow$$ $$01$$  
  $$4$$  $$\longrightarrow$$ $$100$$ ,   $$3$$  $$\longrightarrow$$ $$011$$
  $$8$$  $$\longrightarrow$$ $$1000$$,   $$7$$  $$\longrightarrow$$ $$0111$$
Looking at this, we can see that all of the bits between a power of 2 (lets say the power of 2 is $n$) and $n-1$ are different from eachother, thus, a bitwise AND operation between $n$ and $n-1$ will output 0 if and only if $n$ is a power of 2

With that out of the way, all we'd need to do is just make sure that the given number is greater than 0, as the constraints define $n$ to be any value that can fit in a 32 bit signed integer ($-2^{31} <= n <= 2^{31} $)

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$ O(1) $$

- Space complexity:
$$ O(1) $$

# Code

```python []
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return ((n > 0) and not(n & ( n -1)))
```
```rust []
impl Solution {
    pub fn is_power_of_two(n: i32) -> bool {
         return ((n > 0) && (n & (n -1)==0))
    }
}
```
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && !(n & (n - 1));
    }
};
```
```java []
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
}
```

Hope my explanation helps, I likely would have never thought of this solution on my own before taking any formal logic/computing classes.
Have a great day and happy coding!
